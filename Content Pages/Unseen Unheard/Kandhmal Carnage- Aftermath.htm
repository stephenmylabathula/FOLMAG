violence began in 2008, after the trailer of the same was seen a year earlier
in 2007. The pretext was the murder of Swami Laxmananand, Lakkhanand, who was
working in the area for the last four decades. He was part of the RSS combine,
VHP-Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and was involved in the programs like <i

a forcible conversion of Adivasis to Hinduism. RSS combine asserts that
Adivasis were originally Hindus who fled to forests to avoid being converted to
Islam in particular. This is a political construct and has nothing to do with
the social history. [Adivas natives or tribals are animists not Hindus] The <span

this act was done to stop his activities related to spreading hatred in the
area</span>. Immediately after the murder, Pravin Togadia of VHP took out a
procession with the body of Swami through a long circuitous route spanning 270
km. It was on this route that anti-Christian violence and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

victims of Kandhmal were poor Christians, most of who were dalits and living
below the poverty line. Nearly three hundred Churches were destroyed and four
hundred Christians were done to death. During this time, thousands had to leave
the area and were forced to live in the poorly equipped refugee settlements.
This violence was targeted against the minority Christian community. This
violated the fundamental right to life, liberty and equality guaranteed by the
Indian <span class=GramE>Constitution which</span> was affirmed by many
international covenants. The pattern of violence shows that the attacks were
targeted widespread in the district of Kandhmal. Their execution was done with
meticulous planning and preparation. The violence was preceded by various
activities and the <span class=GramE>planning meetings were held by the
perpetrators prior to the violence</span>. Apart from this meticulous planning
the financial and other forms of assistance were secured months prior to the
violence. The violence meets the criteria of ‘Crimes against Humanity’ as
defined in international law. The blatant brutality of the violence makes it
fall within the definition of ‘torture’ under international laws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

state of justice delivery system as such is abysmal. The communalised state
apparatus blocks the justice at various levels. The story of this obstacle
begins from the registration of cases, then to investigation and then to the
court procedures, the role of public prosecutors and the willpower of the
State. The whole chain shows that justice is hard to get by especially the way
our democracy is being eroded by the communal ideology under various garbs. At
this stage the National Human Rights Commission, Human Rights Law Network came
forward and brought out good reports showing us the mirror of the prevalent
injustice in Kandhmal. A People’s Tribunal was also set up under the
Chairmanship of retired Justice AP Shah. Most of these reports indicted the
communal forces for their aggressive stance and held the State Government
responsible for various acts of omission and commission. Unlike in Gujarat, <span
class=GramE>the BJP, which was part of ruling coalition, was dumped by Biju
Janata Dal</span> after which Naveen Patnaik, the Chief Minister could frankly
speak about the role of BJP and company in their involvement in instigating the
violence against Christians. The <span class=GramE>role of Hindutva
organisations in the carnage was officially acknowledged by the Chief Minister</span>.
In response to a question posed in the Legislative Assembly, the chief minister
of Orissa, Naveen Patnaik, admitted, on the basis of the State’s investigation,
“members of the RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal” were involved in the violence. As per
the Chief Minister, police arrested 85 people from the RSS, 321 members of the
VHP and 118 Bajrang Dal members in the attacks. He said that only 27 members
from these groups were still in jail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dayal, President of All India Catholic Union and member of National Integration
Council points out, “The Chief Minister Patnaik appointed two judicial
commissions…the commonality between the judges of these commissions is the
haste in which they have expressed their high regard for the late VHP leader,
Swami Laxmananand and their belief that the violence is not religiously
motivated but a conflict over land issues between the Tribal Kondhs, mostly
Hindu, and the Dalit Panos, many of whom have converted to Christianity, and
who are demanding Scheduled Caste status.” Like most of the commissions of
inquiry these commissions are also working at a snail’s pace to prove once more
that a delayed report usually becomes useless as for as delivery of justice is
concerned. The Christian community was so disgusted with the attitude of the
commissions that initially they boycotted them but later seeing no other
platform to express their pain and anguish have decided to be part of the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The compensation received is too inadequate to rebuild the life afresh. As far
as justice is concerned while the inquiry commission reports are too slow, the
fast track <span class=GramE>courts which were set up</span> have been
suspended. The proceedings of the cases is going on in an atmosphere where the
guilty are openly threatening the witnesses, and many of them are reluctant to
give evidence out of fear of the accused, who are on bail despite several
serious charges against <span class=GramE>them</span>. Quite like Gujarat,
where many a witness turned hostile! In this scenario the State is backing off
from rebuilding the Churches destroyed during the carnage. The plea being
offered is how a secular State can spend money on places of religious worship.
Again quite like Gujarat! When state is unable to protect a place of worship,
why should it not come forward to re-build it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
